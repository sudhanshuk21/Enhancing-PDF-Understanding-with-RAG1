      "   In Banaras District there is a village called Bira in  which an old, childless \n",
      "widow used to live. She was a  Gond woman named Bhungi and she didn't \n",
      "own either a scrap of land or a house to live in. Her only source of livelihood \n",
      "was a parching oven. The village folk customarily have one meal a day of \n",
      "parched grains, so there was always a crowd around Bhungi's oven. \n",
      "Whatever grain she was paid for parching she would grind or fry and eat it. \n",
      "She slept in a corner of the same little shack that sheltered the oven. As soon \n",
      "as it was light she'd get up and go out to gather dry leaves from all around to \n",
      "make her fire. She would stack the leaves right next to the oven, and after \n",
      "twelve, light the fire. But on the days when she had to parch grain for Pandit \n",
      "Udaybhan Pandey, the owner of the village, she went to bed hungry. She \n",
      "was obliged to work without pay for Pandit Udaybhan Pandey She also had \n",
      "to fetch water for his house. And, for this reason, from time to time the oven \n",
      "was not lit. She lived in the Pandit's village, therefore he had full authority to \n",
      "make her do any sort of odd job. In his opinion if she received food for \n",
      "working from him, how could it be considered as work done without pay? \n",
      "He was doing her a favour, in fact, by letting her live in the village at all.   \n",
      " \n",
      "   It was spring, a day on which the fresh grain was fried and eaten and given \n",
      "as a gift. No fire was lit in the houses Bhungi's oven was being put to good \n",
      "use today. There was a crowd worthy of a village fair around her. She had \n",
      "scarcely opportunity to draw a breath. Because of the customer's impatience, \n",
      "squabbles kept breaking out. Then two servants arrived, each carrying a \n",
      "heaped basket of grain from Pandit Udaybhan with the order to parch it right \n",
      "away. When Bhungi saw the two baskets she was alarmed. It was already \n",
      "after twelve and even by sunset, she would not have time to parch so much \n",
      "grain. Now she would have to stay at the oven parching until after dark for \n",
      "no payment. In despair she took the two baskets. One of the flunkeys said \n",
      "menacingly, 'Don't waste any time or you'll be sorry.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   With this command the servants went away and Bhungi began to parch the \n",
      "grain. It's no laughing matter to parch a whole maund of grain. She had to \n",
      "keep stopping from the parching in order to keep the oven fire going. So by \n",
      "sundown not even half the work was done. She was afraid Panditji's men \n",
      "would be coming. She began to move her hands all the more frantically.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Soon the servants returned and said, 'Well, is the grain parched?'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Feeling bold, Bhungi said, 'Can't you see? I'm parching it now.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'The whole day's gone and you haven't finished any more grain than this! \n",
      "Have you been roasting it or spoiling it? This is completely uncooked! \n",
      "How's it going to be used for food? It's the ruin of us! You’ll see what \n",
      "Panditji does to you for this.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   The result was that that night the oven was dug up and Bhungi was left \n",
      "without a means of livelihood.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Bhungi now had no means of support. The villagers suffered a good deal \n",
      "too from the destruction of the oven. In many houses even at noon, cooked \n",
      "cereal was no longer available. People went to Panditji and asked him to \n",
      "give the order for the old woman's oven to be rebuilt and the fire once more \n",
      "lighted, but he paid no attention to them. He could not suffer a loss of face. \n",
      "A few people who wished her well urged her to move to another village. But \n",
      "her heart would not accept this suggestion. She had spent her fifty miserable \n",
      "years in this village and she loved every leaf on every tree. Here she had \n",
      "known the sorrows and pleasures of life; she could not give it up now in the \n",
      "last days. The very idea of moving distressed her. Sorrow in this village was \n",
      "preferable to happiness in another.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   A month went by. Very early one morning Pandit Udaybhan, taking his \n",
      "little band of servants with him, went out to collect his rents. Now when he \n",
      "looked toward the old woman's oven he fell into a violent rage: it was being \n",
      "made again. Bhungi was energetically rebuilding it with balls of clay Most \n",
      "likely she'd spent the night at this work and wanted to finish it before the sun \n",
      "was high. She knew that she was going against the Pandit's wishes, but she \n",
      "hoped that he had forgotten his anger by then. But alas, the poor creature had \n",
      "gown old without growing wise.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Suddenly Panditji shouted, 'By whose order?'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Bewildered, Bhungi saw that he was standing before her.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   He demanded once again, 'By whose order are you building it?' In a flight \n",
      "she said, 'Everybody said I should build it and so I'm building it.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'I'll have it smashed again. 'With this he kicked the oven. The wet clay \n",
      "collapsed in a heap. He kicked at the trough again but she ran in front of it \n",
      "and took the kick in her side. Rubbing her ribs she said, 'Maharaj, you're not \n",
      "afraid of anybody but you ought to fear God. What good does it do you to \n",
      "ruin me like this! Do you think gold is going to grow out of this small piece \n",
      "of land! For your own good, I'm telling you, don't torment poor people, don't \n",
      "be the death of me.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'You're not going to build any oven here again.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'If I don't how am I going to be able to eat!'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'I'm not responsible for your belly.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'But if I do nothing except chores for you where will I go for food!'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'If you’re going to stay in the village you'll have to do my chores.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'I'll do them when I've built my over?. I can't do your work just for the \n",
      "sake of staying in the village.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'Then don't, just get out of the village.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'How can I! I've grown old in this hut. My in-laws and their grandparents \n",
      "lived in this same hut. Except for Yama, king of death, nobody's going to \n",
      "force me out of it now.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'Excellent, now you're quoting Scripture!' Pandit Udaybhan said. 'lf you'd \n",
      "worked hard I might have let you stay, but after this I won't rest until I've \n",
      "had you thrown out. ‘To his attendants he said, 'Go get a pile of leaves right \n",
      "away and set fire to the whole thing; we'll show her how to make an oven.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   In a moment there was a tremendous racket. The names leapt towards the \n",
      "sky, the blaze spread wildly in all directions till the villagers came clustering \n",
      "around this mountain of fire. Hopelessly, Bhungi stood by her oven \n",
      "watching the conflagration. Suddenly, with a violent dash, she hurled herself \n",
      "into the names. They came running from everywhere but no one had the \n",
      "courage to go into the mouth of the blaze. In a matter of seconds her \n",
      "withered body was completely consumed.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   At that moment the wind rose with a gust. The liberated flames began to \n",
      "race toward the east. There were some peasants' huts near  the oven which \n",
      "were engulfed by the fierce flames. Fed in this way, the blaze spread even \n",
      "further. Panditji's barn was in its path and it pounced upon it. By now the \n",
      "whole village was in a panic. They began to band together to put out the fire \n",
      "but the sprinkle of water acted like oil on it and the flames kept mounting \n",
      "higher. Pandit Udaybhan's splendid mansion was swallowed up; while he \n",
      "watched, it tossed like a ship amid wild waves and disappeared in the sea of \n",
      "fire. The sound of lamentation that broke out amidst the ashes was even \n",
      "more pitiful than Bhungi's grievous cries.    \n",

      "   Munshi Khairat Ali Khan was the inspector of  Sanitation and hundreds of \n",
      "sweeper women depended on him. He was good-hearted and well thought \n",
      "of--not the sort who cut their pay, scolded them or fined them. But he went \n",
      "on regularly rebuking and punishing Alarakkhi. She was not a shirker, nor \n",
      "saucy or slovenly; she was also not at all bad-looking. During these chilly \n",
      "days she would be out with her broom before it was light and go on \n",
      "assiduously sweeping the road until nine. But all the same, she would be \n",
      "penalized. Huseni, her husband, would help her with the work too when he \n",
      "found the chance, but it was in Alarakkhi's fate that she was going to be \n",
      "fined. For others pay-day was an occasion to celebrate, for Alarakkhi it was \n",
      "a time to weep. On that day it was as though her heart had broken. Who \n",
      "could tell how much would be deducted! Like students awaiting the results \n",
      "of their examinations, over and over again she would speculate on the \n",
      "amount of the deduction.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Whenever she got so tired that she'd sit down a moment to catch her \n",
      "breath, precisely then the Inspector would arrive riding in his ekka. No \n",
      "matter how much she'd say, 'Please, Excellency, I’ll go back to work again,' \n",
      "he would jot her name down in his book without listening. A few days later \n",
      "the very same thing would happen again. If she bought a few cents worth of \n",
      "candy from the sweets-vendor and started to eat it, just at that moment the \n",
      "Inspector would drop on her from the devil knew where and once more write \n",
      "her name down in his book. Where could he have been hiding? The minute \n",
      "she began to rest the least bit he was upon her like an evil spirit. If he wrote \n",
      "her name down on only two days, how much would the penalty be then! God \n",
      "knew. More than eight annas? If only it weren't a whole rupee! With her \n",
      "head bowed she'd go to collect her pay and find even more deducted than \n",
      "she'd estimated. Taking her money with trembling hands she'd go home, her \n",
      "eyes full of tears. There was no one to turn to, no one who'd listen.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Today was pay-day again. The past month her unweaned daughter had \n",
      "suffered from coughing and fever. The weather had been exceptionally cold. \n",
      "Partly because of the cold, partly because of the little girl's crying she was \n",
      "kept awake the whole night. Several times she'd come to work late. Khan \n",
      "Sahib had noted down her name, and this time she would be fined half her \n",
      "pay. It was impossible to say how much might be deducted. Early in the \n",
      "morning she picked up the baby, took her broom and went to the street. But \n",
      "the naughty creature wouldn't let herself be put down. Time after time \n",
      "Alarakkhi would threaten her with the arrival of the Inspector. 'He's on his \n",
      "way and he'll beat me and as for you, he'll cut off your nose and ears! 'The \n",
      "child was willing to sacrifice her nose and ears but not to be put down. At \n",
      "last, when Alarakkhi had failed to get rid of her with threats and coaxing \n",
      "alike, she set her down and left her crying and wailing while she started to \n",
      "sweep. But the little wretch wouldn't sit in one place to cry her heart out; she \n",
      "crawled after her mother time and time again, caught her sari, clung to her \n",
      "legs, then wallowed around on the ground and a moment later sat up to start \n",
      "crying again.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'Shut up!' Alarakkhi said, brandishing the broom. 'If you don't, I’ll hit you \n",
      "with the broom and that'll be the end of you. That bastard of an Inspector's \n",
      "going to show up at any moment.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   She had hardly got the words out of her mouth when inspector Khairat Ali \n",

      "her heart began to thump. 'Oh God, may my head fall off if he heard me! \n",
      "Right in front of me and I didn't see him. Who could tell he'd come on his \n",
      "bicycle today? He's always come in his ekka. ‘The blood froze in her veins, \n",
      "she stood holding the broom as though paralyzed.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Angrily the Inspector said, 'Why do you drag the kid after you to work! \n",
      "Why didn't you leave it at home!'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'She's sick, Excellency' Alarakkhi said timidly. 'Who's at home to leave her \n",

      " \n",
      "   'What's the matter with her?'  \n",
      " \n",

      "you abusing me!'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Alarakkhi felt all her breath knocked out of her. If you'd cut her there \n",
      "wouldn't have been any blood. Trembling she said, 'No, Huzoor, may my \n",
      "head fall off if I was abusing you.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   And she burst into tears.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   In the evening Huseni and Alarakkhi went to collect her pay. She was very \n",
      "downcast.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'Why so sad?' Huseni tried to console her. 'The pay's going to be cut, so let \n",
      "them cut it. I swear on your life from now on  I won't touch another drop of \n",
      "booze or toddy.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'I'm afraid I'm fired. Damn my tongue! How could I....’  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'If you're fired, then you're fired, but let Allah be merciful to him. Why go \n",
      "on crying about it?’  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'You’ve made me come for nothing. Everyone of those women will laugh \n",

      "When the Inspector heard her abuse him why didn't he even scold her? Why \n",
      "didn't he ~re her on the spot! She wasn't able to work it out, he actually \n",
      "seemed kind. She couldn't manage to understand this mystery. She was \n",
      "afraid. He had decided to fire her- that must have been why he was so nice. \n",
      "She'd heard that a man about to be hanged is given a fine last meal, they \n",
      "have to give him anything he wants-so surely the Inspector was going to \n",
      "dismiss her. They reached the municipal office building. The pay began to \n",
      "be distributed. The sweeper women were first. Whoever's name was called \n",
      "would go running and taking her money call down undeserved blessings on \n",
      "the Inspector and go away. Alarakkhi’s name was always called after \n",

      "beginning to whisper.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   One after another the names were called and Alarakkhi went on looking at \n",

      " \n",
      "   Suddenly startled, she heard her name. Slowly she stood up and walked \n",

      " \n",

      "wasn't his own field, but as he got closer this deluded hope died. He'd been \n",
      "struck by the very misfortune he'd set out to avert. Buddhu had started the \n",
      "fire and was ruining the whole village because of him. As he ran it seemed \n",
      "to him that today his held was a lot nearer than it used to be, as though the \n",
      "fallow land between had ceased to exist.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   When he finally reached his field the fire had assumed dreadful \n",
      "proportions. Jhingur began to wail. The villagers were running and ripping \n",
      "up stalks of millet to beat the tire. Among the men Buddhu was the most \n",
      "valiant fighter; with his dhoti tucked up around his waist he leapt into the \n",
      "fiery gulfs as though ready to subdue the enemy or die, and he'd emerge \n",
      "after many a narrow escape. In the end it was the men who triumphed, but \n",

      " \n",
      "   Jhingur was even more grieved by these taunts than by the destruction of \n",

      "thought and decided that Buddhu had to be put in a situation exactly like his \n",
      "own. Buddhu had ruined him and he was wallowing in comfort, so Jhingur \n",

      " \n",
      "   Since the day of their terrible quarrel Buddhu had ceased to come by \n",

      "show him he had no suspicion at all that Buddhu started the fire. One day, on \n",
      "the pretext of getting a blanket,  he went to Buddhu, who greeted him with \n",
      "every courtesy and honour--for a man offers the hookah even to an enemy \n",
      "and won't let him depart without making him drink milk and syrup.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   These days Jhingur was earning a living by working  in a jute-wrapping \n",
      "mill. Usually he got several days wages at once. Only by means of Buddhu's \n",
      "help could he meet his daily expenses between times. So it was that Jhingur \n",
      "re-established a friendly footing between them.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Spring came and the peasants were getting the fields ready for planting \n",
      "cane. Buddhu was doing a fine business. Everybody wanted his sheep. There \n",
      "were always a half dozen men at his door fawning on him, and he lorded it \n",
      "over everybody. He doubled the price of hiring out his sheep to manure the \n",
      "field; if anybody objected he'd say bluntly, 'Look, brother, I'm not shoving \n",
      "my sheep on you. If you don't want them, don't take them. But I can't let you \n",
      "have them for a pice less than I said. 'The result was that everybody \n",
      "swarmed around him, despite his rudeness, just like priests after some \n",
      "pilgrim. Buddhu's house also began to grow. A veranda was built in front of \n",
      "the door, six rooms replaced the former two. In short, the house was done \n",
      "over from top to bottom. Buddhu got the wood from a peasant, from another \n",
      "the cow dung cakes for the kiln fuel to make the tiles; somebody else gave \n",
      "him the bamboo and reeds for the mats. He had to pay for having the walls \n",
      "put up but he didn't give any cash even for this; he gave some lambs. Such is \n",
      "the power of Lakshmi: the whole job--and it was quite a good house, all in \n",
      "all--was put up for nothing. They began to prepare for a house-warming.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Jhingur was still labouring all day with but getting enough to half fill his \n",
      "belly, while gold was raining on Buddhu's house. If Jhingur was angry, who \n",
      "could blame him! Nobody could put up with such injustice.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   One day Jhingur went out walking in the direction of the untouchable \n",
      "tanners' settlement. He called for Harihar, who came out, greeting him with \n",
      "'Ram Ram!' and filled the hookah. They began to smoke. Harihar, the leader \n",
      "of the tamers, was ? mean fellow and there wasn't a peasant who didn't \n",
      "tremble at the sight of him.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   After smoking a bit, Jhingur said, 'No singing for the spring festival these \n",
      "days! We haven't heard you.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'What festival? The belly can't take a holiday. Tell me, how are you getting \n",
      "on lately?'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'Getting by,' Jhingur said. 'Hard times mean a hard life. If I work all day in \n",
      "the mill there's a tire in my stove. But these days only Buddhu's making \n",
      "money. He doesn't have room to store it! He's built a new house, bought \n",
      "more sheep. Now there's a big hiss about his house-warming. He's sent paan \n",
      "to the headmen of all the seven villages around to invite everybody to it.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Then Jhingur and Harihar began to whisper, plotting their course of action-\n",
      "-the method, the time and all the steps. When Jhingur left he was strutting--\n",
      "he'd already overcome his enemy, there was no way for Buddhu to escape \n",
      "now.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   On his way to work the next day he stopped by Buddhu's house. Buddhu \n",
      "asked him, 'Aren't you working today?' 'I'm on my way, but I came by to ask \n",
      "you if you wouldn't let my calf graze with your sheep. The poor thing's \n",
      "dying tied up to the post while I'm away all day, she doesn't get enough grass \n",
      "and fodder to eat.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'Brother, I don't keep cows and buffaloes. You know the tanners, they're \n",
      "all killers. That Harihar killed my two cows, I don't know what he fed them. \n",
      "Since then I've vowed never again to keep cattle.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   But yours is just a calf, there'd be no profit to anyone in harming her. \n",
      "Bring her over whenever you want.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Then he began to show Jhingur the arrangements for the house-warming. \n",
      "Ghee, sugar, flour and vegetables were all on hand. All they were waiting \n",
      "for was the Satyanarayan ceremony. Jhingur's eyes were popping. When he \n",
      "came home after work the first thing he did was bring his calf to Buddhu's \n",
      "house. That night the ceremony was performed and a feast offered to the \n",
      "Brahmans. The whole night passed in lavishing hospitality on the priests. \n",
      "Buddhu had no opportunity to go to look after his flock of sheep.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   The feasting went on until morning. Buddhu had just got up and had his \n",
      "breakfast when a man came and said, 'Buddhu, while you've been sitting \n",
      "around here, out there in your hock the calf has died. You're a fine one! The \n",
      "rope was still around its neck.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   When Buddhu heard this it was as though he'd been punched. Jhingur, who \n",
      "was there having some breakfast too, said,' Oh God, my calf? Come on, I \n",
      "want to see her! But listen, I never tied her with a rope. I brought her to the \n",
      "flock of sheep and went back home. When did you have her tied with a rope, \n",
      "Buddhu''  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'God's my witness, I never touched any rope! I haven't been back to my \n",

      " \n",
      "   'If you didn't, then who put the rope on her!' Jhingur said. 'You must have \n",
      "done it and forgotten it.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'And it was in your flock,' one of the Brahmans said. 'People are going to \n",
      "say that whoever tied the rope, that heifer died because of Buddhu's \n",
      "negligence.'               \n",
      " \n",

      "plotting, but if he said a thousand times that he hadn't put the rope on the \n",

      "the streets, then a pilgrimage to the seven holy places, and in addition the \n",
      "price for five cows and feeding 500 Brahmans. Stunned, Buddhu listened to \n",

      "bitter insults. Whatever he picked up during the day he'd cook in the evening \n",
      "under some tree and then go to sleep right there. He did not mind the \n",
      "hardship, for he was used to wandering all day with his sheep and sleeping \n",

      "bamboo cot wrapped up in his old burlap shawl, shivering. Underneath the \n",

      "why did you come out here!, Now you'll have to bear the cold, there's \n",
      "nothing I can do. You thought I was coming out here to eat puris and sweets \n",

      " \n",
      "   After he finished smoking Halku lay down and made up his mind that \n",
      "however things were he would sleep now. But in only one minute his he \n",
      "began to pound. He turned from side to side, but like some kind of witch the \n",
      "cold weather continued to torment him.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   When he could no longer bear it he gently picked Jabra up and, patting his \n",
      "he; got him to fall asleep in his lap. The dog's body gave off some kind of \n",
      "stink but Halku, hugging him tight, experienced a happiness he hadn't felt \n",
      "for months. Jabra probably thought he was in heaven, and in Halku’s \n",
      "innocent heart there  no resentment of his smell. He embraced him with the \n",
      "very same affection he would have felt for a brother or a friend.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Suddenly Jabra picked up the noise of some animal. This special intimacy \n",
      "had produced a new alertness in him that disdained the onslaught of the \n",
      "wind. Springing up, he ran out of the shelter and began to bark. Halku \n",
      "whistled and called him several times. But Jabra would not come back to \n",
      "him. He went on barking while he ran around through the furrows of the \n",
      "field. He would come back for a moment, then dash off again at once.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Another hour passed. The night fanned up the cold with the wind. Halku \n",
      "sat up and bringing both knees tight against his chest hid his face between \n",
      "them, but the cold was just as biting. It seemed is though all his blood had \n",
      "frozen, that ice rather than blood filled his veins. He leaned back to look at \n",
      "the skies. How much of the night was still left! Only a stone's throw from \n",
      "Halku's field there was a mango grove. Halku thought, 'If I go and get a pile \n",
      "of leaves I can make a tire of them and keep warm. If anybody sees me \n",
      "gathering the leaves in the dead of night they'll think it's a ghost. Of course \n",
      "there's a chance some animal's hidden in my field waiting, but I can't stand \n",
      "sitting here any longer.' He ripped up some stalks from a nearby field, made \n",
      "a broom out of them and picking up a lighted cow dung cake went toward \n",
      "the grove. Jabra watched him coming and ran to him wagging his tail. Halku \n",
      "said, 'I couldn't stand it any more, Jabra. Come along, let's go into the \n",
      "orchard and gather leaves to warm up with. When we're toasted we'll come \n",
      "back and sleep. The night's still far from over.' Jabra barked his agreement \n",
      "and trotted on toward the orchard.   \n",
      " \n",
      "   Suddenly a gust carried the scene of henna blossoms to him. 'Where's that \n",
      "sweet smell coming from, Jabra?'  \n",
      " \n",
      "    Jabra had found a bone lying somewhere and he was chewing on it. Halku \n",
      "set his fire down on the ground and began to gather the leaves. In a little \n",
      "while he had a great heap. His hands were frozen, his bare feet numb.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   In a little while the fire was burning merrily. The dames leapt upward \n",
      "licking at the overhanging  branches. In the flickering light the immense \n",
      "trees of the grove looked as though they were carrying the vast darkness on \n",
      "their heads. In the blissful sea of darkness the firelight seemed to pitch and \n",
      "toss like a boat.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Halku sat before the fire and let it warm him. After a while he took off his \n",
      "shawl and tucked it behind him, then he  spread out both feet as though \n",
      "challenging the cold to do its worst. Victorious over the immense power of \n",
      "the winter, he could not repress his pride in his triumph.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   He said to Jabra, 'Well, Jabra, you're not cold now, are you!' Jabra barked \n",
      "as though to say, 'How could I feel cold now!'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   The leaves were all burned up. Darkness covered the orchard again. Under \n",
      "the ashes a few embers smouldered.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Halku wrapped himself up in his shawl again and sat by the warm ashes \n",
      "humming a tune. The fire had warmed him , through but as the cold began to \n",
      "spread he felt drowsy. Jabra gave a loud bark and ran toward the field.    \n",
      "Halku realized chat this meant a pack of wild animals had probably broken \n",
      "into the field. They might be nilgai. He distinctly heard the noise of their \n",
      "moving around. Then it seemed to him they must be grazing; he began to \n",
      "hear the sound of nibbling. He thought, ‘No, with Jabra around no animal \n",
      "can get into the field, he'd rip it to shreds. I must have been mistaken. Now \n",
      "there's no sound at all. How could I have been mistaken!'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   He shouted, ‘Jabra! Jabra!'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Jabra went on barking and did not come to him. Then again there was the \n",
      "sound of munching and crunching in the field. He could not have been \n",
      "mistaken this time. It really hurt to think about getting up from where he \n",
      "was. It was so comfortable there that it seemed intolerable to go to the field \n",
      "in this cold and chase after animals. He didn't stir.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   He shouted at the top of his lungs, 'Hillo! Hillo! Hillo!'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Jabra started barking again. There were animals eating his held just when \n",
      "the crop was ready. What a fine crop it was! And these cursed animals were \n",
      "destroying it. With a firm resolve he got up and took a few steps. But \n",
      "suddenly a blast of wind pierced him with a sting like a scorpion's so that he \n",
      "went back and sat again by the extinguished ~re and stirred up the ashes to \n",
      "warm his chilled body. Jabra was barking his lungs out, the nilgai were \n",
      "devastating his field and Halku went on sitting peacefully near the warm \n",
      "ashes. His drowsiness held him motionless as though with ropes. Wrapped \n",
      "in his shawl he fell asleep on the warmed ground near the ashes.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   When he woke in the morning the sun was high and Munni was saying, \n",
      "‘Do you think you’re going to sleep all day! You came out here and had a \n",
      "fine time while the whole field was being flattened!'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Halku got up and said, ‘Then you've just come from the field!' 'Yes, it's all \n",
      "ruined. And you could sleep like that! Why did you bother to put up the \n",
      "shelter anyway?'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Halku sought an excuse. 'I nearly died and just managed to get through the \n",
      "night and you worry about your crop. I had such a pain in my belly I can't \n",
      "describe it.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Then the two of them walked to the edge of their land. He looked: the \n",

      "shelter as though he were dead.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   They continued to stare at the ruined field. Munni's face was shadowed \n",
      "with grief but Halku was content.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Munni said, ‘Now you'll have to hire yourself out to earn some money to \n",
      "pay off the rent and taxes.'  \n",

      "the knee-bends.  \n",

      "this car was doing the driving himself. Slowing dawn he tried to creep \n",
      "through us gradually when I advanced and caught him by the ears, shook \n",
      "him violently and after giving him a slap on both cheeks, said, ‘Don’t splash \n",
      "with the car, understand! Move along politely.' But he began to gabble until \n",

      "were of fine Pachai stock, of great stature, beautiful to behold, and diligent \n",
      "at their labours. The two had lived together for a very long time and become \n",
      "sworn brothers. Face to face or side by side they would hold discussions in \n",
      "their silent language. How each understood  the other’s thoughts we cannot \n",
      "say, but they certainly possessed some mysterious power. They would \n",
      "express their love by licking and sniffing one another, and sometimes they \n",
      "would even lock horns – not from hostility but rather out of friendship and a \n",
      "sense of fun, the way friends as soon as they become intimate slap and \n",
      "pummel and another; any friendship lacking such displays seems rather \n",
      "superficial and insipid and not to be trusted. When they were released from \n",
      "the yoke after their day’s work at noon or in the evening they would lick and \n",
      "nuzzle one another to ease their fatigue. When the oilseed cake and straw \n",
      "was tossed into the manager they would stand up together, thrust their \n",
      "muzzles in to the trough together, and sit down side by side. When one \n",
      "withdrew his mouth the other would do so too.   \n",
      " \n",
      "   On one occasion Jhuri sent the pair to his father-in-law’s. How could the \n",
      "bullocks know why they were being sent away? They assumed that the \n",
      "master had sold them. If God had given them speech, they would have asked \n",
      "Jhuri, 'Why are you throwing us poor wretches out! We've done everything \n",
      "possible to serve you well. If working as hard as we did couldn't get the job \n",
      "done, you could have made us work still harder. We were willing to die \n",
      "labouring for you. We never complained about the food, whatever you gave \n",
      "us to eat we bowed our heads and ate it, so why did you sell us into the \n",
      "hands of this tyrant?'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   At evening the two bullocks reached their new place, hungry after a whole \n",
      "day without food, but when they were brought to the manger, neither so \n",
      "much as stuck his mouth in. Their hearts were heavy; they were separated \n",
      "from the home they had thought was their own. New house, new village, \n",
      "new people, all seemed alien to them.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   They consulted in their mute language, glancing at one another out of the \n",
      "corners of their eyes, and lay down. When the village was deep in sleep the \n",
      "two of them pulled hard, broke their together and set out for home. That \n",
      "tether was very tough, no one could have guessed that any bullock could \n",
      "break it; but a redoubled power had entered into them and the ropes snapped \n",
      "with one violent jerk.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   When he got up early in the morning Jhuri saw that his two bullocks were \n",
      "standing at the trough, half a tether dangling from each of their necks. Their \n",
      "legs were muddled up to the knees and resentful love gleamed in their eyes.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   When Jhuri saw the bullocks he was overwhelmed with affection for them. \n",
      "He ran and threw his arms around their necks, and very pleasant was the \n",
      "spectacle of that loving embrace and kissing.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   The children of the household and the village boys gathered, clapping their \n",
      "hands in welcome.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   One boy said, 'Nobody has bullocks like these: and another agreed, 'They \n",
      "came back from so far all by themselves: while a third said, 'They're not \n",
      "bullocks, in an earlier life they were men. ‘And nobody dared disagree \n",
      "with*this.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   But when Jhuri's wife saw the bullocks at the gate she got angry and said, \n",
      "‘What loafers these oxen are, they didn't work at my father's place for one \n",
      "day before they ran away!'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Jhuri could not listen to his bullocks being slandered like this. 'Loafers, are \n",
      "they? At your father's they must not have fed them so what were they to do?'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   In her overbearing way his wife said, 'Oh sure, you're the only one who \n",
      "knows how to feed bullocks while everybody else gives them nothing but \n",
      "water. Jhuri railed at her, ‘If they'd been fed why would they run off?'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Aggravated, she said, ‘They ran away just because those people don't \n",
      "make fools of themselves spoiling them like you. They feed them but they \n",
      "also make them work hard. These two are real lazy-bones and they ran away. \n",
      "Let’s see them get oilseed and bran now? I'll give them nothing but dry \n",
      "straw, they can eat it or drop dead.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   So it came about. The hired hand was given strict orders to feed them \n",
      "nothing but dry straw.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   When the bullocks put their faces in the trough they found it insipid. No \n",
      "savour, no juice--how could they eat it? With eyes full of hope they began to \n",
      "stare toward the door.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Jhuri said to the hired hand, ‘Why the devil don't you throw in a little \n",
      "oilseed?’  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'The mistress would surely kill me.’ \n",
      " \n",
      "   'Then do it on the sly.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'Oh no, boss, afterwards you'll side with her.   \n",
      " \n",
      "   The next day Jhuri’s brother-in-law came again and took the bullocks \n",
      "away. This time he yoked them to the wagon. A couple of times Moti \n",
      "wanted to knock the wagon into the ditch, but Hira, who was more tolerant, \n",
      "held him back.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   When they reached the house, Gaya tied them with thick ropes and paid \n",
      "them back for yesterday's mischief. Again he threw down the same dry \n",
      "straw. To his own bullocks he gave oilseed cake, ground lentils, everything.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   The two bullocks had never suffered such an insult. Jhuri wouldn't strike \n",
      "them even with a newer stem. The two of them would rise up at a click of \n",
      "his tongue, while here they were beaten. Along with the pain of injured pride \n",
      "they had to put up with dry straw. They didn't even bother to look in the \n",
      "trough.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   The next day Gaya yoked them to the plow, but it was as though the two of \n",
      "them had sworn an oath not to lift a foot--he grew tired beating them but not \n",
      "one foot would they lift. One time when the cruel fellow delivered a sharp \n",
      "blow on Hira's nostrils Moti's anger went out of control and he took to his \n",
      "heels with the plow. Plough-share, rope, yoke, harness, all were smashed to \n",
      "pieces. Had there not been strong ropes around their necks it would have \n",
      "been impossible to catch the two of them.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Hira said in his silent language, 'Its useless to run away  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Moti answered, 'But, he was going to kill you.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'We'll really get beaten now.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'So what! We were born bullocks, how can we escape beating!'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'Gaya's coming on the run with a couple of men and they're both carrying \n",
      "sticks.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Moti said. 'Just say the word and I’ll show them a little fun. Here he comes \n",
      "with his stick!'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'No, brother!' Hira cautioned. ‘Just stand still.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'If he beats me I’ll knock one or two of them down.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'No, that's not the dharma of our community.'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Moti could only stand, protesting violently in his heart. Gaya arrived, \n",
      "caught them and took them away. Fortunately he didn't beat them this time, \n",
      "for if he had Moti would have struck back. When they saw his fierce look \n",
      "Gaya and his helpers concluded that this time it would be best to put it off.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   This day again the same dry straw was brought to them. They stood in \n",
      "silence. In the house the people were eating dinner. Just then a quite young \n",
      "girl came out carrying a couple of pieces of bread. She fed the two of them \n",
      "and went away. How could a piece of bread still their hunger? But in their \n",
      "hearts they felt as though they had been fed a full meal. Here too was the \n",
      "dwelling of some gentle folk. The girl was Bharo’s daughter; her mother was \n",
      "dead and her stepmother beat her often, so that she felt a kind of sympathy \n",
      "for the bullocks. The two were yoked all day, took a lot of beatings, got \n",
      "stubborn. In the evening they were tied up in their stall, and at night the \n",
      "same little girl would come out and feed some bread to each of them. The \n",
      "happy result of this communion of love was that even though they ate only a \n",
      "few mouthfuls of the dry straw they did not grow weak; still their eyes and \n",
      "every cell of their bodies filled with rebelliousness.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   One day Moti said in his silent language, 'I can't stand it any longer, Hira. \n",
      "So what do you say, tonight we'll break the ropes and run away!'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'Yes, I’ll agree to that, but how can we break such a thick rope!'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'There is a way. First gnaw the rope' a bit, then it will snap with one jerk'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   At night when the girl had fed them and gone off the two began to gnaw \n",
      "their ropes, but the   thick cord wouldn't fit in their mouths. The poor fellows \n",
      "tried hard over and over again without any luck. Suddenly the door of the \n",
      "house opened and the same girl came out; the bullocks I lowered their herds \n",
      "and began to lick her hand. Their tails stood up while she stroked their \n",
      "foreheads, and then she said, 'I'm going to let you go. Be very quiet and run \n",
      "away or these people will kill you. In the house today they were talking \n",
      "about putting rings in your noses.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   She untied the rope, but the two stood silent.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   'Well, let's go: said Hira, 'only tomorrow this orphan's going to be in a lot \n",
      "of trouble. Everybody in the house will suspect her.'  \n",

      "daddy, come quick, they're running away!'  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Gaya came rushing out of the house to catch the bullocks. They were \n",
      "running now, with Gaya fast behind them. They ran even faster and Gaya set \n",
      "up a shout. Then he turned back to fetch some men of the village. This was \n",
      "the chance for the two friends to make good their escape, and they ran \n",
      "straight ahead, no longer aware by now just where they were. There was no \n",
      "trace of the familiar road they'd come by. They were coming to villages \n",
      "they'd never seen. Then the two of them halted at the edge of a field and \n",
      "began to think about what they ought to do now.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Hira said, 'It appears we've lost our way.'  \n",

      " \n",
      "   They had scarcely eaten a couple of mouthfuls when two men with sticks \n",
      "came running and surrounded the two friends. Hira was on the embankment \n",
      "and slipped away, but Moti was down in the soggy field. His hooves were so \n",
      "deep in mud that he couldn't run, and be was caught. When Hira saw his \n",
      "comrade in trouble he dashed back. If they were going to be trapped, then \n",
      "they'd be trapped together So the watchmen caught him too.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Early in the morning the two friends were shut up in a village pound. The \n",
      "two friends stayed tied up there for a week. No one gave them so much as a \n",
      "bit of hay. True, water was given to them once. This was all their \n",
      "nourishment. They got so weak that they could not even stand up, and their \n",
      "ribs were sticking out. One day someone beat a drum outside the enclosure \n",
      "and towards noon about fifty or sixty people gathered there. Then the two \n",
      "friends were brought out and the inspection began. People came and studied \n",
      "their appearance and went away disappointed. Who would buy bullocks that \n",
      "looked like corpses!  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Suddenly there came a bearded man with red eyes and a cruel race; he dug \n",
      "his fingers into the haunches of the bullocks and began to talk with the clerk. \n",
      "When they saw his expression the hearts of the two friends grew weak from \n",
      "what their intuition told them. They had no doubt at all as to who he was and \n",
      "why he felt them with his hands. They looked at one another with frightened \n",
      "eyes and lowered their heads.  \n",
      " \n",

      " \n",
      "   Along the way they saw a herd of cows and bullocks grazing in a verdant \n",
      "meadow. All the animals were happy, sleek and supple. Some were leaping \n",

      " \n",
      "   Suddenly it seemed to them that the road was familiar. Yes, this was the \n",

      "were sure Ma was asleep, they got up quietly, unlatched the door, and crept \n",
      "out. Soon they were making preparations to safeguard the eggs. Keshav \n",
      "brought a stool from the room, but it was still not high enough to reach the \n",
      "cornice. He then brought a small bathing stool to place under the first and \n",

      "grab the cornice to steady himself, and scold Shyama under his breath, 'Hold \n",
      "fast or I'll come down and beat you nicely: But poor  Shyama's attention was \n",

      " \n",
      "   Shyama brought the bowl of water and rice too. Keshav placed them both \n",

      "after the chicks.  \n",
      " \n",
      "    The two birds would approach the cornice only to quickly fly away again. \n",

      " \n",
      "   Keshav had opened the latch, but Shyama didn't say that to Ma. She was \n",
      "scared that he might get a beating. Keshav was afraid that Shyama might \n",
      "squeal. He hadn't shown her the eggs, and so didn't trust her. Whether \n",
      "Shyama was silent out of love or because she was party to the crime is a \n",
      "matter of some conjecture. Perhaps it was both.  \n",
      " \n",

      "effort he opened the door and woke Nagin.  \n",
      " \n",

      "didn't like this crowd and he got so angry with Munga that if he had had the \n",

      "saw Munga lying motionless.  It is impossible to describe the sensation this \n",

      "Whatever prestige he'd been able to maintain vanished. Munga had come to \n",

      " \n",
      "   Munshi Ramsevak was versed in law: according to the law he was \n",

      "to get up and shut it. Finally Nagin took a lamp, Munshiji his axe and \n",
      "Ramgulam the sickle, and the three of them, quaking and shrinking, went to \n",

      " \n",
      "   But Munga had got under their skins. Seeing their own shadow they'd \n",

      "The very slightest tap would startle them. If there was a rustling of leaves the \n",
      "hair would stand up on all three of them  \n",
      " \n",
      "   At midnight Nagin was startled from her sleep. It seemed to her chat \n",
      "Munga, with her red eyes and sharp pointed teeth, was sitting on her chest. \n",
      "Nagin screamed.  She started running toward the courtyard like a \n",
      "madwoman, and suddenly she fell senseless to the ground, sweating all over. \n",
      "Munshiji had been awakened by her yell but he was so frightened he didn't \n",
      "open his eyes. Like a blind man he felt his way to the door. After a long \n",
      "while he found it and came into the courtyard. Nagin was lying on the \n",
      "ground. Fear of Munga had killed her. While Munga lived she had always \n",
      "feared Nagin's hissing. But sacrificing her own life, she could now take \n",
      "Nagin's.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   Having done away with Nagin, Munga was not going to leave Munshiji \n",
      "alone. At every moment her image remained before his eyes. Wherever he \n",

      " \n",
      "   Like a prisoner in solitary confinement, somehow or other he managed to \n",

      "went to the open court. Today his expression was a little brighter, today, he \n",
      "thought, his clients would nock around him, they'd condole with him and \n",
      "he'd shed a few tears. Then there would be an abundance of foreclosures, \n",

      "   But there, instead of the abundance of mortgages and the flood of \n",
      "foreclosures and the merry greetings of clients, he encountered the sandy \n",
      "wastes of disappointment. He sat for hours with his satchel open but nobody \n",
      "came near him, or even inquired about how he was. Not only were there no \n",
      "new clients but very old ones, whose business Munshiji$ family had handled \n",

      "soon as he came close to the house Munga's image rose before him. He was \n",
      "so nervous that when on opening the door two dogs, shut in by Ramgulam, \n",
      "came rushing out he completely lost his wits, let out a shriek and fell \n",
      "senseless to the ground.  \n",
      " \n",
      "   What happened to Munshiji after this is not known. For several days \n",

      " \n",
      "   One day a sadhu came to the village--on his forehead ashes, locks long and \n",

      "Ramsevak's and his speech also was not much different. He sat in meditation \n",
      "beneath a tree. That night smoke rose from Ramsevak's house, the glow of a \n",
